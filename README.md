## Personal website used as a portfolio to show of my web-development skills
The code of this site is currently very simple and or messy. In the future I hope to remake most (if not all) of the code, markup and even the styling from scratch. 

Visit the page regularly to view updates on skills and information about me and what I can offer as a web-developer to your company.
